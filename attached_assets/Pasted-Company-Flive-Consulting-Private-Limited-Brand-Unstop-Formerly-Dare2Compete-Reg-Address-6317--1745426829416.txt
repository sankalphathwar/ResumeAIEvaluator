HR-Tech Innovation Challenge: AI-Powered Resume Screening
& Employee Engagement Analysis
Problem Statement
In this assignment let’s aims to automate two critical HR processes:
1. Resume Screening: Develop an AI tool to filter resumes for a "Software Engineer" role by matching
skills, experience, and qualifications from job descriptions.
2. Employee Sentiment Analysis: Analyze employee feedback (e.g., surveys, exit interviews) to predict
attrition risks and recommend engagement strategies.
Your Task:
1. Use Azure AI Studio or Google AI Studio to build and deploy models for the above tasks.
2. Apply prompt engineering to optimize outputs from large language models (LLMs) for accuracy and
relevance.
3. Propose a detailed technical approach, including data pipelines, model selection, and integration
strategies.
